This is a project for our Midterm exam on the course CS426 - Mobile Device Application Development.

Some special features of our app:
- Show a list of products, their prices and description.
- Filter products by category, and you can search for the product that you are looking for.
- Check the detail of each product and add it to the cart.
- In the cart screen, you can add or remove the products that are in the cart, and see the total price of them.
- You can mark a product as a favorite to see it later.
- Map will show the location of the shop you select.
